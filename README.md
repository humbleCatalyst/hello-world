# hello-world
to learn
My name is Jamzee (nick-name) and I am a 29 year-old male who is just now getting started in life. Why so late? Well for now I will just say it was due to my slow mental/emotional development.  To be 100% honest with you, Im in the process of creating a repository-->Branch-->commit-->"open a pull request-->"merge pull request; and I have no idea what this means. Ultimately I want to learn what GitHub is and how to use it because my MAIN learning endeavor at this point is learning code, onto development, etc(where ever the energy directs) I do wish I would have learned about these things from my lifes start, because there is something about it that I cant get enough of. So if anyone does happen to read this, I would love to find a partner or mentor. Where I live is not a place that you would find others in this feild or even close! I am very serious and I wont give up. Someone help me! thanks!
